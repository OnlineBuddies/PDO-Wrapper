OLB_PDO

  beginTransaction
    In order to induce these we will need to mock PDO itself.
      PDO::beginTransaction throwing a non-retryable exception
      PDO::beginTransaction returning false
  
  logRetry
  logWarning
  logRetry
    The code involved here are just calls to error_log and are usually overridden.

OLB_PDO_STH

  rewind
    Used in iterator mode when working with multiple rowsets.

  prepare
    On reconnect, resetting:
      fetchMode, bindValues, bindParams, bindColumns and attrs

  dump
    On errors, printing out:
      bindValues, bindParams, bindColumns, attrs and fetchMode

  execute
    Error thrown after running out of retries.
    This will require a mock PDOStatement object:
      PDOStatement::execute throwing a non-PDOException

  setAttribute
  getAttribute
    This may require a mock PDOStatement object, as most drivers do not actually implement statement handle attributes.
